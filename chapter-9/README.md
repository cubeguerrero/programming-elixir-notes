# An Aside -- What are Types?

The first thing to understand is that the primitive data types are not necessarily the same as the types they can represent. I.e. lists in Elixir are just an order group of values. We also have the `List` module which provides a set of functions that operate on lists.

The primitive list is an implementation, whereas the `List` module adds a layer of abstraction.
